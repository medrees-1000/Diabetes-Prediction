# 🩺 Diabetes Prediction Project

This project uses machine learning to predict whether a person is likely to have diabetes based on medical features such as age, BMI, blood glucose level, and more. It uses a cleaned and processed dataset and supports testing new synthetic patients.

## 📁 Project Structure
- `Diabete.ipynb`: Main notebook for training, evaluation, and predictions  
- `Logistic Classification.ipynb`: Supporting notebook used for baseline model structure  
- `diabetes_prediction.csv`: Main dataset  
- `best_model_pipeline.py`: (optional, generated by TPOT)  
- `synthetic_predictions.csv`: Generated predictions on 20 random cases  
- `README.md`: You're reading it!

## ⚙️ Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone this repo
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/diabetes-prediction.git
cd diabetes-prediction
```

### 2. Create a virtual environment
```bash
python -m venv env
```

### 3. Activate the environment

- **Windows (PowerShell):**
```bash
.\env\Scripts\Activate.ps1
```

- **Linux/macOS:**
```bash
source env/bin/activate
```

### 4. Install dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 🧪 How to Run the Project

1. Launch Jupyter Notebook or VS Code  
2. Open `Diabete.ipynb`  
3. Run all cells from top to bottom:  
   - Data Cleaning & Preprocessing  
   - Feature Encoding & Scaling  
   - Model Training (XGBoost, SVM, etc.)  
   - Class Imbalance Handling (SMOTE)  
   - Model Evaluation  
   - TPOT AutoML (Optional)  
4. Use the final section to predict on **synthetic patient data**

## 💡 Features

- SMOTE balancing to address class imbalance  
- Multiple ML models: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM, XGBoost  
- Evaluation via accuracy, F1-score, recall, precision, and confusion matrix  
- TPOT AutoML to automatically find the best pipeline  
- Realistic 1000-row synthetic prediction with model confidence

## 🤖 How to Predict New Cases

A batch of 20 random patient profiles is generated and passed through:
- The trained model  
- A preprocessing pipeline  
- Output: prediction (0 or 1) and probability of diabetes  

See the function: `predict_synthetic_batch(...)`

## ✅ Requirements

Install with:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Main libraries:
- pandas  
- numpy  
- scikit-learn  
- xgboost  
- seaborn  
- matplotlib  
- imbalanced-learn
