2) Data Visualizations:
Which plots to make and what to look for?
Class Distribution (Bar Plot)

Check if the dataset is imbalanced (Diabetic vs. Non-Diabetic).
Histograms / KDE Plots for Numerical Features

age, bmi, HbA1c_level, blood_glucose_level
Look for skewness, outliers, and normality.
Boxplots

To detect outliers in: bmi, HbA1c_level, blood_glucose_level, age
Outliers could indicate erroneous data or extreme cases.
Correlation Heatmap

Identify relationships between numerical variables.
Helps in feature selection.
Bar Plot for Categorical Variables (gender, smoking_history)

Understand distributions and their relationship with diabetes.
Pairplot / Scatterplot Matrix

To see how features relate to diabetes.

these were the things you told me for visualzirion any other ones or not?

Violin Plots (Alternative to Boxplots)

Why? More detailed than boxplotsâ€”they show density, quartiles, and outliers in one visualization.
Use for: bmi, HbA1c_level, blood_glucose_level, and age grouped by diabetes (0 vs. 1).
Stacked Bar Plot for smoking_history vs. diabetes

Why? You already planned a bar plot for smoking_history, but a stacked version grouped by diabetes (0 vs. 1) can reveal patterns 
(e.g., if smokers have a higher diabetes rate).

ðŸ”¥ Final Visualization Plan
âœ… Class Imbalance Check
Bar Plot: diabetes (0 vs. 1)
âœ… Numerical Feature Distribution & Outliers
Histograms/KDE Plots: age, bmi, HbA1c_level, blood_glucose_level
Boxplots: age, bmi, HbA1c_level, blood_glucose_level
Violin Plots (New): Same variables grouped by diabetes
âœ… Feature Relationships
Correlation Heatmap: Identify relationships among numerical features.
Pairplot/Scatterplot Matrix: Explore feature interactions with diabetes.
âœ… Categorical Data Analysis
Bar Plot: gender, smoking_history
Stacked Bar Plot (New): smoking_history grouped by diabetes
Now, you have every essential visualization needed for deep EDA!
Let me know if youâ€™re ready to proceed ðŸš€.




Next Steps after Moving to Visualization
Handle Outliers:


Cap BMI values above 60 or below 12.
Review blood glucose values above 250.
Address Class Imbalance:

Use stratified sampling when splitting data.
SMOTE or weighting strategies during model training.
Ensure Proper Encoding for Categorical Variables:

Convert gender and smoking_history into numeric representations.
